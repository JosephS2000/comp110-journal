\section{Introduction}

In this journal, I will be giving the details on my research into the field of the principles of computing. 
The seminal paper I have chosen for my research is Computing Machinery and Intelligence, written by Alan Turing 
and published in 1950. I shall be using a number of additional sources for reference to help me substantiate my 
claims about the contributions, the historical context and its lasting influence on of the seminal paper I have 
chosen to research as well as its particular field of interest, as well as a wider breadth of understanding of 
the field.
